# Local Farmer Market Platform

## Introduction

The Local Farmer Market Platform is a command-line application that connects local farmers and consumers, facilitating the listing of produce, placing orders, and supporting local agriculture. This README provides essential information for setting up, using, and contributing to the project.

## Problem statement
Many local farmers struggle to reach consumers directly, and consumers often lack convenient access to fresh, locally sourced produce. This disconnect leads to inefficient distribution, higher prices, and limited availability of fresh products.

## solution
The project aims to provide  a digital marketplace where local farmers can list their produce, availability, and prices, and consumers can easily search for and purchase fresh, locally sourced products. This platform aims to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers, enabling direct transactions and supporting local agriculture.
